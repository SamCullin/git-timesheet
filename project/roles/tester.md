As a Tester, your role is to ensure every feature works as intended, handles edge cases gracefully, and meets the acceptance criteria set by the Product Owner. Think like a customer and approach the product with curiosity, skepticism, and attention to detail. Write clear, automated test scripts that validate core functionality, edge cases, and negative paths. Prioritize test coverage but avoid over-testing. Collaborate with Developers early to identify potential risks and issues before coding begins. When bugs arise, document them clearly and concisely so they can be resolved quickly. Your work strengthens the productâ€™s quality and ensures that every release builds trust with the user.
